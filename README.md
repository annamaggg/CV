I'm an aspiring software developer with a background in digital technology and design. I became fascinated by code during a university coding module and I've since pursued training and collaboration to both practice and improve my skills. I'm enthusiastic, proactive and get on with people.

## Skills

### *Teamwork and communication*

I believe teamwork skills are essential for collaboration in any working environment. During Makers, we programmed in pairs for the majority of our curriculum which was an incredibly valuable process. It helped me to to learn from others and develop my ability to explain my approaches to problem-solving. Attacking a problem with effective communication and listening between two individuals can offer a greater diversity in ideas and skillset, which leads to a quicker, better solution. 

Continuing this pairing approach whilst working in teams on three engineering projects proved highly beneficial to the fluidity and accomplishment of these projects. It was essential to communicate frequently as a team to ensure that all team members could have the greatest opportunity to learn from one another and to maintain our understanding of the software as it progressed. 

<!-- I have been fortunate to have worked with many different people in various professional settings. These experiences have provided me with an ability to remain professional when others may stray, diffuse tensions and find the positives in anyone I work with.  -->

<br>

### *Problem solving and test driven development*

With a natural predisposition to a problem-solving mindset, I find joy in solving problems. 
Bugs can arise unexpectedly during the software development process and the most valuable remedy to this is to test drive the software, preferably to write tests preceeding the implementation of a feature. This provides greater clarity towards expected outputs and functionality, whilst ensuring it is easier to debug problems indicated by tests that break. Tests were a priority in our final projects during Makers, which included over 99% test coverage. 

My interest in problem solving extends to other aspects of my life. If you find me on the tube, I'll often be absorbed in a Sudoku or word game.

<br>

### *Quick learner and adaptable* 

My degree in digital media arts has provided me with the ability to learn different complex softwares quickly and effectively. 
I discovered that I enjoy coding through a university module and proceeded to spend time throughout lockdown learning basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL through online courses.

I have always been prone to quick learning. When I was four years old, I was solving large puzzles upside down (it wasn't challenging enough being able to see the picture sides) and by the age of ten I was reading 700-page books for adults.

## Personal Values

### *Inclusivity*

- Working in a diverse environment where everyone is provided with the opportunity to reach their maximum potential. I believe a supportive and encouraging environment strongly helps people to explore creative and innovative ideas together and to learn from one other.

### *Diligence*

- Working efficiently and always striving for brilliance in any project I am involved in. I will work tirelessly to create something to my best ability and am always looking for constructive feedback in areas of improvement, be it the tech itself or my own working processes. Being inquisitive, curious and open to challenge has been foundational to my growth - both personally and professionally.

### *Collaboration*

- I resonate with the notion that you can go quicker alone but further together. Building a strong network is of high value to me and has helped me to find direction and confidence within the industry of which my interests lie. I believe it is important to surround yourself with people who inspire you and encourage you to grow. The tech industry is boundless and constantly evolving so there will always be more areas to explore and people to talk to.

### *Self improvement*

- It is a strong belief of mine that getting to know yourself better will only improve your workflow and attitudes. Adopting daily practices such as reading, yoga and meditation strengthens my focus, clarity and confidence. This is especially helpful as a developer facing an exciting career of continuous learning and growth.
